SoundJS is a library to make working with audio on the web easier. It provides a consistent API for playing audio in
different browsers, including using a target plugin model to provide an easy way to provide additional audio plugins
like a Flash fallback (included, but must be used separately from the combined/minified version).

[CreateJS](https://createjs.com/) suite: [EaselJS](https://github.com/createjs/easeljs),
[PreloadJS](https://github.com/createjs/preloadjs), and [TweenJS](https://github.com/createjs/tweenjs).
